### **🚀 Project Overview**
This AI-driven framework is designed to automate the production of high-quality short-form content. By leveraging the **Veda System**, the bot intelligently identifies the most engaging segments of a video and transforms them into viral-ready reels.

### **📂 System Components (Folder Logic)**
As seen in the project structure, the system is divided into functional modules:

* **📁 input_anime**: Direct intake for raw video assets (`.mp4`, `.mkv`, `.webm`).
* **📁 songs**: Library for background music synchronization. The AI mixes tracks at 15% volume for optimal balance.
* **📁 READY_TO_UPLOAD**: The output zone for processed cinematic content with white-plane padding ("Parda") and filters.
* **📁 completed**: Automatic archival folder for processed episodes to ensure an organized workspace.
* **📄 worker.py**: The core automation engine handling video processing, RMS peak scanning, and styling.
